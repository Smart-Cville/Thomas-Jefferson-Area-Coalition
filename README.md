# Problem
In order to help connect those in need to locally available resources, TJACH regularly distributes a printed “street sheet” to its clients listing vital programs (food, shelter, clothing) that are currently available in the city.

# Team Challenge
Create a soltuion to distribute the street sheet more widely, ensure accuracy of its information, and allow for its content to be easily updated.

# Background
The Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless (TJACH) aims to make homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring in our community.

TJACH works to reduce homelessness by initiating creative solutions and coordinating regional resources and services. TJACH is the HUD-designated coordinator of the Continuum of Care for this community, supporting system improvement and collaboration to ensure a secure safety net for the homeless and very poor.
