# Problem
In order to help connect those in need to locally available resources, TJACH regularly distributes a printed “street sheet” to its clients listing vital programs (food, shelter, clothing) that are currently available in the city.

# Team Challenge
Create a soltuion to distribute the street sheet more widely, ensure accuracy of its information, and allow for its content to be easily updated.
